# JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

In tic-tac-toe, the idea is to get 3 X's or 3 O's in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. This is a two player game. Players then alternate clicking on an available spot to claim it with their symbol (either X or O). When one player wins, or the game contains no more available spots on the board, the game is over. This action clears the board and restarts the game.

## Your Challenge

You'll build a tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript using jQuery to help with manipulating the DOM. No starter files are available to you. You'll need at least an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file (ideally, you'll have multiple JavaScript files to help you stay organized). All the logic for the game should be encapsulated in functions written in JavaScript.

The goal of this challenge is to have a functional tic-tac-toe game - you can choose to take it as far as you'd like. You may want to show the winner on the page after the game or add additional functionality! 

## Finished?

Submit a PR back to this repository with an overview of your approach to this challenge and a description of the easiest/hardest part of this challenge.

## Extension

Create the functionality for a user to play against the computer. The computer will always choose the spot with the highest chances to win. This is to check and make sure I am receiving events on my webhook.
